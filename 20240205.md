first public note trying a new system

key todos
- gpt4 expensive for openinterpreter so play w linking the local models
- imgs push to andrewyu0/me? i want to keep clean but also good balance for high efficiency info transmiss
- permissionless projects prs ayn

adding section from morning: 

heres the plan
problem â€“ scattered log of learning, code, journal. private and public. as many false starts is ok as long as a system sticks 
principles - file over app - add kepano here
other inspos - yacine dot ca 
markdown everything means
- github commit for code but also writing journal blog etc
- leverage all the obs tools plugins eg timestamp 08:58
- can also note changes in my thinking w commit msgs + diffs. ofc for training data for my life ai asst companion. proof is there my 10+ years of journing in evernote and other apps paid off and were easily converted and merged into the ssot knowledge graph
- accountability public - less opt to fall off
- openinterpreter (oi) - barely scratched surface great convo w killian yday about first taste of applying magic of oi on my knowledge base. turn terminal outputs and in terminal learnings directly into md files and save to obsidian (to be used forever as long as my lifelong kb of md files exists. bananas) 08:56
steps - basically mini speccing this out
1. create repo for me to push to 
2. create public folder within my local obs to add remote - keep scoped sandboxed there
3. push this first md as first commit 08:58
leverage natural strengths of obs to save time cost and max efficiency 
1. daily page auto gen so just use that 08:59 (sidenote this is cool, later i can just ask llm to look at time stamps and do a timebased overview of my thoughts - neat! bender voice lol)
public stream of consciousness blog yacine style as a nice supp to getting your thoughts out there 
ok - push this initial block so u dont procrastinate 09:01
09:06 gonna emulate swyx https://github.com/swyxio/brain

09:47 big win so far dont get caught up in yak shaving lol
